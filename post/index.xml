      <description>Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to develop an interest in woodworking (because finding time for my existing hobbies hasn&amp;rsquo;t been hard enough). It started while doing some home renovation work and picking up a few new tools: router, table saw, etc.
Then, as Jen got into spinning, I started to want to make round things, so I started looking for a lathe. Eventually I managed to find a small one on sale for a decent price and started turning.</description>

      <description>I recently started drinking tea. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true&amp;mdash;I recently started drinking tisane (herbal tea), specifically peppermint tea.
I started drinking peppermint because it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to have some medicinal properties, particularly in relieving IBS symptoms. At first I treated it as a potential treatment; I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy drinking it, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t horrible. But over the past several weeks, the taste has really grown on me, and I now look forward to sitting down with my cuppa.</description>
