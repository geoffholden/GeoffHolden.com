Hi, I'm Geoff Holden and you've found my little corner of the Internet.

I'm a software developer by trade, with experience in system administration and a little bit of web design. You can find more information about my professional life via my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](resume/) or on [LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/geoffholden/).

By night, I'm an amateur photographer, focusing mostly on landscapes around Newfoundland (and elsewhere when I have the opportunity to travel). My photography can be seen on [GKH Photography](http://gkhphoto.com/) or on [500px](http://500px.com/geoffholden).
