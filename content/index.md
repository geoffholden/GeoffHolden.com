I'm Geoff Holden, a software developer living in St. John's, Newfoundland. You can find out more about my professional life via my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/), or perhaps on [LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/geoffholden/).

I'm not really sure what content will be here yet. I suspect it'll be a mix of thoughts on software development along with me trying to take control of my own health.
