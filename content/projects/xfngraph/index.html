<h1>XFN Graph</h1>
<p>
	XFN Graph now has it's own page at <a href="http://xfngraph.sf.net">xfngraph.sf.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Ever since I first looked at
	<a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/"><abbr title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</abbr></a>,
	Myself and <a href="http://www.brianscube.com" rel="met friend">Brian</a>
	said that it should have some sort of graphing tool. I couldn't find one,
	so I started one. After I released version 1.0,
	<a href="http://web.nickshanks.com/blog/" rel="contact">Nicholas Shanks</a> has come
	onboard and has fixed a
	<a href="http://web.nickshanks.com/blog/archive/000023.html">number of things</a>
	to warrant a 1.1 release.
</p>

<p>
	It's still pretty rough around the edges, but here are two images that
	I've created with it:

</ul>
