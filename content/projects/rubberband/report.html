<P>This is the gun solution that was seen as the best choice from the group
of Geoff Holden, and Nicholas Howlett. The gun was chosen over our
other ideas because of its simplicity in being easy to load and to
manufacture.</P>
<P>The hardest part to make was the sprocket. You have to drill eight holes
in it at equal spaced intervals, to put the spokes in. You also have
to drill a hole through the centre in order to screw it to the
handle. In the handle you drill out a section on an angle and put in
a small cylinder in its place to rest the front of the elastic on.
There is also a section that is to be milled out to put the sprocket
in. A hole has to be drilled in this section where you want the
centre of the sprocket to be. After the handle and sprocket are made
to the above specifications you only need four more things that you
can go buy at any hardware store: a carriage bolt, wing nut, washer
and friction washer. Put the bolt in through the hole in the handle.
Next put the friction washer on followed by the sprocket. The
friction washer is there to provide friction so the wing nut doesn't
have to be as tight. Next put the washer and finally the wing nut.
The gun is now assembled.</P>
<P>Now that the gun is together it is now the explanation of use. You put
the first elastic around the front notch and pull it back around a
spoke. You then wind the wheel back and repeat the procedure with the
next spoke. There is enough space to do this for seven elastics. The
nut keeps it tight so that the sprocket will only move when you pull
the trigger, which is the spoke sticking out by handle. At a certain
point in the revolution of the sprocket the spoke can not hold the
elastic bands. This is when you get one to fire. The other feature is
that if you loosen the nut after it is loaded you will get a
rapid-fire gun.</P>
<P>In the process of building the gun, we were able to test for the optimal
barrel length that would not break the elastic bands. We found this
to be about 290mm from the centre of the sprocket.</P>
<P>When the gun was finished we discovered another small flaw, as you fire,
the sprocket gets tighter to turn. We found the cause of this problem
to be the hex-head bolt we were using had dug itself into the handle.
We then tried a carriage bolt and found that its round head was still
dug in, but was still able to spin.</P>
<P>We also made a website about the gun and its design. We included the
digital photos we took of the gun, and a VRML model. The website is
located at http://www.engr.mun.ca/~holden/rubberband/</P>
