<h1>Digital Photography with The Gimp</h1>
<p>This is the accompying notes for my talk given to the St. John's
Linux Users Group on October 21st, 2004.</p>

<h2>What you need</h2>
<p>To get started in digital photography, there are a few things
that you will need. (Some of which you may already have)</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Camera (digital or film)</dt>
	<dd>
		This one is pretty self-explanitory... You're going to need
		some way of actually taking the pictures, so get yourself a camera,
		I suggest digital, and at least 3 mega pixels.
	</dd>

	<dt>Scanner</dt>
	<dd>
		If you plan on using a film camera, you'll probably want a scanner
		to get the photos on to the computer. (Probably, because most
		photo processing labs will now offer to put all your photos on a CD
		when you get your film developed). The other benefit to having a 
		scanner (even if you have a digital camera) is that you can scan in
		other people'a photos, or old photos that you can restore.
	</dd>

	<dt>Tripod</dt>
	<dd>
		A tripod is a pretty cheap investment (mine was $10 at Walmart) that
		can help you take better photos. When taking pictures in low-light,
		or without a flash, the camera may need a lot of exposure time. In
		these cases, the camera needs to be kept perfectly still, otherwise
		your picture will be blurred.
	</dd>

	<dt>Memory Card</dt>
	<dd>
		Most digital cameras come with a very limited amount of internal
		memory. This amount is <i>never</i> enough. Go get a big card, as big
		as you can afford. There is nothing worse than having to pass up
		a shot because your card is full, or having to delete photos to make
		space for new ones. Once you have a big memory card, set your camera
		to the highest resolution that it's capable of, and leave it there.
		You can decrease the resolution on the computer later, but you can't
		add in more. You never know what shot might turn ou really well.
	</dd>

	<dt>Card Reader</dt>
	<dd>
		You can read the photos off you digital camera just by connecting
		the camera to the computer using the (normally) supplied USB cable.
		But, most cameras only support USB 1.1, and are therefore pretty
		slow. The <i>x</i>-in-1 card readers are pretty inexpensive (mine was $30)
		and also give you the added benefit of being able to read the cards
		from friends cameras, etc.
	</dd>

	<dt>Batteries</dt>
	<dd>
		Digital Cameras can go through batteries pretty quickly. If your
		camera takes regular AA's, get some high-capacity (&gt;2000mAh) NiMh
		batteries and a charger. If your camera takes a special battery pack,
		get an extra one. You don't want to get into a situation where you
		want to catch another shot, but you camera's dead.

<p>The Screen Savers had an article on
<a href="http://www.g4techtv.com/screensavers/features/49877/Essential_Digicam_Accessories_.html">Essential Digicam Accessories</a>
that covers these things as well.</p>


<h2>Calibrating your Monitor</h2>
<p>Calibrating your monitor is crucial if you plan on getting prints made
of any of your photos. It's even pretty important if you plan on keeping
the photos in the digital domain, because it will help them look the same
on different people's computers.</p>
<p>The actual process is pretty straightforward. You adjust the lighting
in the room, and change the settings on your monitor until a calibration
image looks right. Instead of me going into the details here, I'm going
to refer you to Norman Koren's excellent
<a href="http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1A.html">article</a>
on the topic.</p>

<h2>Learn your Camera</h2>
<p>This point can't be stressed enough. Take that little book that came
with your camera, and read it. Play with your camera and all the settings.
Take photos indoors, outdoors, low-light, backlit, etc. under different
settings. Find out what works best where. As an example, I found my camera
took really dark photos when indoors using the flash... things get a lot
better when I lock the ISO speed at 200 in these conditions).</p>

<h2>Take Good Pictures</h2>
<p>The better your pictures begin, the better they will end up. (not always
true, but it helps) Read a few
<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=photography+tips">pages</a>
on photography and learn how to set yourself up for better shots.</p>

<h2>Using The Gimp</h2>
<p>You can get The Gimp from
<a href="http://www.gimp.org">http://www.gimp.org</a>. After it's installed,
you may want to browse and/or bookmark the manual at
<a href="http://docs.gimp.org">http://docs.gimp.org</a>. Go through the
manual and find out what all the tools are, and what they do. As with the
'Learn Your Camera' heading above, knowing your tools is very important.</p>
<p>Once you get a feeling for using the Gimp, and you'd like to do some of
the useful tasks I demonstrated, head on over to
<a href="http://www.gimpguru.org">http://www.gimpguru.org</a>. This site
has a lot of tutorials and tips on how to do pretty much everything I
demonstrated and more.
